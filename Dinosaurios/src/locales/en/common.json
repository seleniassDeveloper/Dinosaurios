      "p2": "At 10 meters (33 feet) long and over five tons, with claws up to 40 cm (16 in), it was built for lethal speed and power.",
      "p3": "Nicknamed the “Shadow of Death,” Maip was named after an Aonikenk spirit said to kill with icy winds. Its second name, macrothorax, reflects its enormous 1.2-meter-wide chest cavity. Unlike the bulky T. Rex, Maip was lightweight, agile, and fast, making it the apex predator of southern Patagonia about 70 million years ago.",

      "tag": "Discovered By Accident During a Game",
      "p1": "In the Jurassic wetlands of Patagonia, our team uncovered the world’s oldest known tadpole fossil, preserved for over 161 million years. Measuring 16 cm (6 in), this giant tadpole belonged to Notobatrachus degiustoi, an extinct frog that lived alongside dinosaurs.",
      "p2": "The skeleton includes the skull, neck and back vertebrae, nearly complete arms, hind legs, and ribs—a treasure trove that allows scientists to reconstruct its power in extraordinary detail. Taurovenator’s neck was reinforced with extra bone connections, giving it the strength to hold up a colossal 1.3-meter skull with horn-like crests above its eyes.",
      "p3": "What makes the discovery even more remarkable is the way it happened. After a long day of digging for dinosaurs, members of our team were relaxing and tossing rocks when one noticed a stone with a strange imprint. That “funny-looking rock” turned out to be a scientific treasure: a 161-million-year-old tadpole, pushing back evidence of frog metamorphosis by more than 30 million years.",

      "p1": "In the badlands of Patagonia, our team unearthed one of the most complete skeletons ever found of a giant South American predator: Taurovenator violantei, the “Bull Hunter.” Measuring 11 meters (36 feet) in length and weighing around five tons, this dinosaur stood among the top hunters of its time, a true rival to Tyrannosaurus rex",
      "p2": "This discovery proved that monotremes — the egg-laying mammals that include today’s platypus and echidna — lived in South America far earlier than once believed (alongside dinosaurs). Previously, scientists thought they came only from Australia after the dinosaurs’ extinction.",
      "p3": "Living 90 million years ago, this predator ruled the forests of Gondwana. Its discovery in the Pueblo Blanco Reserve (Río Negro) cements Patagonia as one of the world’s richest fossil frontiers and showcases the fearsome diversity of apex predators that once stalked the southern continents.",
      "p4": "This single tooth didn’t just add to Patagonia’s fossil record — it rewrote the evolutionary history of monotremes, revealing that the ancestor of today’s platypus was Patagonian.",
